# Android Malware Detector

## Overview

The Android Malware Detector is a project aimed at developing an efficient and lightweight system for detecting malicious Android applications. With the exponential growth of smartphone usage and the increasing prevalence of Android malware, there is a pressing need for robust malware detection systems.

This project focuses on building a permission-based malware detector using a new dataset and significantly fewer permissions compared to existing approaches. The goal is to create a system that is both accurate and efficient in identifying malicious Android apps, even when using minimal features.

## Key Points

- **Rapid Increase in Android Malware:** The popularity of smartphones, particularly Android devices, has led to a surge in malicious Android applications. Studies show that there are over 4 million malicious Android apps in the market, with approximately 11 thousand new malware samples emerging each day.

- **Challenges in Malware Detection:** Many existing malware detection systems require extensive features from both dynamic and static analysis, making them less scalable and lightweight. Additionally, most studies that have focused on limited features, such as only permission data, have used outdated datasets.

- **Our Approach:** In this project, we address these challenges by developing a permission-based malware detection system with a new dataset and significantly fewer permissions. We initially use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and all extracted permission data as features to build our classification model.

- **Results:** The initial SVM-based model achieved impressive results with an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 97.41 percent, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches that used older datasets. We also tested other machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, which yielded similar results, with tree-based algorithms performing slightly better.

- **Lightweight System:** To create a lightweight malware detection system, we reduced the number of permissions or features through a two-step process. Even after reducing the number of permissions by about 94 percent in the first step, the accuracy dropped by only 2.7 percent. In the second step, we further reduced the number of permissions to just 9 while maintaining an accuracy of 93 percent.
